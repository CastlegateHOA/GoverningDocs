The undersigned, confirms that a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of Castlegate Community Association, an Arizona nonprofit corporation, approved the following actions at a duly called meeting of the Board held on October 16, 2024.

RESOLVED that the Board of Directors hereby approves the following Amendment to the Castlegate Community Association Community Guidelines and Rules dated June 2023:

## Community Guidelines

### Basketball Goals and Backboards
Homeowners must submit an application to the Committee for approval prior to the installation or placement of a permanent basketball goal or backboard. Strict guidelines will be adhered to regarding the quality of equipment and installation and special attention will be paid to placement of the pole on the lot. Backboards may be transparent or a standard type with highly visible logo material prohibited. No lighting designed to illuminate basketball goals or backboards shall be installed without prior written approval of the Committee. All basketball goals or backboards must be maintained in a near new condition.

Portable basketball goals or backboards must be stored on the homeowner's lot and may not be stored on sidewalks, roadways, or common areas. Portable basketball goals or backboards must also be sufficiently weighted or secured so they do not tip or fall (such as due to windy weather).

### Landscape Guidelines
Rear yard structures which are taller than the fence or are visible from outside the property (swings, gazebos, permanent basketball goals or backboards, trampolines, etc.) also require approval. All yards must be maintained in a neat, weed-free, debris free condition. No tree, shrub, or plant of any kind on any Lot may overhang or otherwise encroach upon any sidewalk or other pedestrian way from ground level to a height of eight (8) feet.

EXCEPT as amended by this Consent to Action, the Community Guidelines and Rules for the Castlegate Community Association dated June 2023 remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this consent as of

Devin Rich, President and Director

Castlegate Community Association Board of Directors
