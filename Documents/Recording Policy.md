Per to A.R.S. ยง33-1804(A), the Board of Directors has the authority to adopt reasonable rules governing the audiotaping and videotaping of open Board Meetings and Member Meetings. Pursuant to this authority, the Board of Directors adopts the following resolution regarding rules for the audiotaping or videotaping of Open Board Meetings and Member Meetings.

1. For in person meetings, the audiotaping or videotaping device must always be visible to the Board of Directors while audiotaping or videotaping.
2. For in person meetings, the audiotaping or videotaping device and any tripod used must not obstruct the view of any person in attendance at the meeting.
3. For in person meetings, all audiotaping or videotaping devices must run on batteries. The Association cannot guarantee that power will be available and power cords cause a tripping hazard to those in attendance.
