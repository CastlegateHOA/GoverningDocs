### 2.5. Proxies.

At all meetings of the Members a vote may be cast in person or by proxy. A Member may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the Member by signing an appointment form, either personally or by the Member's attorney-in-fact. A proxy is valid for eleven months unless a shorter period is expressly provided in the appointment form. An appointment of a proxy is effective on receipt by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment of a proxy is revocable unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. Appointment of a proxy is revoked by the Member who appoints a proxy by either: (a) attending any meeting and voting in person or (b) signing and delivering to the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate proxy votes either a writing stating that the appointment of the proxy is revoked or a subsequent appointment form. The death or incapacity of the Member who appoints a proxy shall not affect the right of the Association to accept the proxy's authority unless the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes receives written notice of the death or incapacity before the proxy exercises authority under the appointment.

### 2.6. Record Date.

For any meeting of the Members, the Board shall fix a date as the record date for determining the Members entitled to notice of the meeting.

The Board shall also fix a date as the record date for determining the Members entitled to vote at the meeting.

A determination of Members entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Members is effective for any adjournment of the meeting, unless the Board fixed a new date for determining the right to notice or the right to vote. The Board shall fix a new date for determining the right to notice or the right to vote if the meeting is adjourned to a date that is More than seventy (70) days after the record date for determining Members entitled to notice of the original meeting.

The Board shall fix a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful action of the Members, If a record date is not fixed by the Board, Members at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating to that record date, or the sixtieth (60th) day before the date of other action, whichever is later, are entitled to exercise those rights.

The record date fixed by the Board under this Section shall not be more than seventy (70) days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of Members. If a court orders a meeting adjourned to another date, the original record date for notice of voting continues in effect.

### 2.7. Organization and Conduct of Meeting,

All Members attending a meeting of the Members shall register with the Secretary (or such person or persons as may be designated by the Secretary) prior to commencement of the meeting, and all proxies must be filed with the Secretary (or such person or persons as may be designated by the Secretary) prior to commencement of the meeting. After the meeting is called to order by the chair of the meeting, no further proxies or changes, substitutions or revocation of proxies shall be accepted. All meetings of the Members will be called to order and chaired by the President of the Association, or if there is no President or if the President is absent or so requests, then by the Vice President. If both the President and Vice President are not preset at the meeting, any other officer of the Association or such member of the Association as is appointed by the Board may call the meeting to order and chair the meeting. The chair of the meeting may appoint any person (whether or not a Member of the Association) to act as Recording Secretary. The chair of the meeting shall have the authority to determine the order of business to be conducted at the meeting and to establish reasonable rules for expediting the business of the meeting, but the rulings of the chair with respect to such Matters may be overruled by Members having more than fifty percent (50%) of the votes represented in person or by proxy at the meeting.

### 2.8. Action by Written Ballot.

Any action that the Association may take at any annual, regular or special meeting of the Members may be taken without a meeting if the Association delivers a written ballot to every Member entitled to vote on the matter. The written ballot shall set forth each proposed action and provide an opportunity to vote for or against each proposed action. All solicitations for votes by written ballot shall: (a) indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirements; (b) state the percentage of approvals necessary to approve each matter other than election of directors; and (c) specify the time by which a ballot must be delivered to the Association in order to be counted, which time shall not be less than three (3) days after the date that the Association delivers the ballot. Once a written ballot has been received by the Association, the ballot may not be revoked. Approval by written ballot pursuant to this Section is valid only if both the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes which would be required to approve the matter at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.

### 2.9 Action by Written Consent.

The members may approve any action required or permitted by law that requires the Members' approval with a meeting of the Members if the action is approved by Members holding at least a majority of the Eligible Votes, unless the Declaration, Articles, these Bylaws or applicable law require a different amount of Eligible Votes. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the actions taken, signed by those Members representing at least the requisite amount of the Eligible Votes, and delivered to the Association for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records of the Association.

If not otherwise fixed by the Board pursuant to Section 2.6, the record date for determining Members entitled to take action without a meeting is the date the first Member signs the consent to the action. A consent signed under this Section has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document. Written notice of Member approval pursuant to this Section shall be given to all Members who have not signed the written consent. Unless otherwise specified in the consent or consents, the action is effective on the date that the consent or consents are signed by the last Member whose signature results in the requisite amount of the Eligible Votes. Any Member may revoke the Member's consent by delivering a signed revocation of the consent to the President or Secretary before the date that the consent or  consents are signed by the last Member whose signature results in the requisite amount of the Eligible Votes.

### 2.10. Voting Requirements.

Unless otherwise provided in the Community Documents, if a quorum is present at a meeting of the Members, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes represented and voting is the act of the Members.

The Board may increase or decrease the number of directors on the Board within the minimum and maximum number of directors prescribed by this Section, but the number of directors must always be an odd number. If the number of directors is increased by the Board, the persons appointed to fill the vacancies created by the new directorships shall serve until the next annual meeting of the Members at which time the Members shall determine the term of office of each new directorship and elect a successor to the person appointed by the Board.

In order to establish and maintain continuity of the Board, the three (3) Members seeking to be elected to the Board receiving the highest number of votes shall be elected to a three (3) year term, the next two (2) Members seeking to be elected to the Board receiving the next highest number of votes shall be elected to a two (2) year term, and the next two (2) Members seeking to be elected to the Board receiving the next highest number of votes shall be elected to a one (1) year term. In each subsequent election of directors, each director shall serve for a two (2) year term, except that the Board may adjust term lengths as necessary to preserve staggered terms.

Despite the expiration of a director's term, a director shall continue to hold office until the director's successor is elected, designated or appointed and qualified, until the director's resignation or removal, or until there is a decrease in the number of directors.

### 3.2. Appointment and Election.

Until the termination of the Developer Control Period, the Developer shall have the right to appoint and remove the members of the Board. After the termination of the Developer Control Period, the directors shall be elected by the Members at the annual meeting of the Members. For each election of directors, the Board shall either prescribe an opening and closing date of a reasonable filing period in which each eligible person may declare their candidacy for election to the Board by giving written notice thereof to the Secretary of the Association or appoint a Nominating Committee to nominate candidates for election to the Board. The Board may also establish such other rules and regulations as it deems appropriate with respect to the nomination and election of directors. In each election of directors, the number of candidates equal to the number of positions to be filled receiving the greatest number of votes shall be deemed elected. Cumulative voting will not be permitted in the election of directors.

### 3.3. Resignation of Directors.

A director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the Board, its presiding officer or the Association. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date or event. If a resignation is made effective at a later date, the Board may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the Board provides that the successor does not take office until the effective date.

### 3.4. Removal of Directors.

Except for directors appointed by the Developer, any one or more of the members of the Board may be removed from the Board with or without cause by Members holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the Eligible Votes.

### 3.5. Compensation.

No director shall receive compensation for any service he may render to the Association, unless such compensation is approved by Members holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the Eligible Votes. However, any director may be reimbursed for his actual expenses incurred in the performance of his duties.

### 3.6. Action Taken Without a Meeting.

The directors shall have the right to take any action in the absence of a meeting which they could take at a meeting by obtaining the written consent of all the directors. Any such written consent shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board. Any action taken by the Board pursuant to this Section shall be effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date.

### 3.7. Vacancies.

Until the termination of the Developer Control Period, any vacancy on the Board shall be filled by the Developer. After the termination of the Developer Control Period, any vacancy occurring in the Board may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum or by a sole remaining director, and any director so chosen shall serve the remainder of the term of the director he replaces. Any newly created directorship shall be deemed a vacancy. If by reason of death, resignation or otherwise, the Association has no directors in office, any officer or Member may call a special meeting of the Members for the purpose of electing the Board.

### 3.8. Meetings.

If the time and place of a meeting of the Board is fixed by the Board, the meeting is a regular meeting. All other meetings of the Board are special meetings. Regular meetings of the Board may be held with or without notice to the directors of the date, time, place or purpose of the meeting.

Special meetings of the Board may be called by the President on two (2) business days notice to each director, given in writing, by hand delivery, mail or telegraph, which notice shall state the time, place and purpose of the meeting. Special meetings of the Board shall be called by the President or Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of at least two (2) directors.

A director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the director of the meeting, unless the director at the beginning of the meeting or promptly on the director's arrival at the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.

A director may participate in a regular or special meeting of the Board through the use of any means of communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting, and a director participating in a meeting by such means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

Notice of meetings of the Board shall be given to the Members of the Association within such time and in such manner as is required by law.

### 3.9. Quorum and Voting.

A majority of the prescribed number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is present when a meeting is convened, the quorum shall be deemed to exist until the meeting is adjourned, notwithstanding the departure of one or more directors. If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present is the act of the Board, unless the Articles or Bylaws require the vote of a greater number of directors.

A director who is present at a meeting of the Board when corporate action is taken is deemed to have assented to the action taken unless either: (a) the director objects at the beginning of the meeting or promptly on the director's arrival to holding it or transacting business at the meeting; (b) the director's dissent or abstention from the action taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or (c) the director delivers written notice of the director's dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its adjournment or to the Association before 5:00 P.M. on the next business day after the meeting. The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a director who votes in favor of the action taken.

A director may vote in person or by proxy. A director may appoint another director as a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the director by signing an appointment form, either personally or by the director's attorney-in-fact. The appointment does not relieve the director of liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors. An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the Secretary. An appointment is valid for one (1) month unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment form. An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the director. The death or incapacity of a director appoint a proxy shall not affect the right of the Association to accept the proxy's authority unless written notice of death or incapacity is received by the Secretary before the proxy exercises its authority under the appointment. Subject to any express limitation on the proxy's authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, the Association is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as the vote of the director making the appointment.

### 3.10. Powers and Duties.

The Board shall have all of the powers and duties necessary for the administration of the Association's affairs and for performing all responsibilities and exercising all rights of the Association as set forth in the Community Documents or as provided by law.
