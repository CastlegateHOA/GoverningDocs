# Community Guidelines and Association Rules
(Adopted June 16, 2003; November 2020; June 2023)

## Community Organization
Every homeowner of Castlegate is a member of the Castlegate Homeowners' Association (the “Association"), the entity responsible for the management of all common areas and related homeowner’s facilities as well as administration of the affairs of the community. The Association is created by the recording of the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, Restrictions, Reservations and Easements (the "CC&Rs"). The CC&Rs set forth procedures, rules and regulations, which govern the community. These "Design Guidelines and Association rules" are an extension of the CC&Rs and they are designed to be used in harmony.

The Board of Directors (the "Board") is charged with the responsibility for overseeing the business of the Association and has a wide range of powers. The Design Review Committee (the "Committee") is established by the Board to review all improvements within Castlegate including new construction, modifications to existing properties and landscaping. The Committee has adopted Design Review guidelines and standards to evaluate proposed construction activities. The Committee is hereby empowered to supplement and amend the Design Review guidelines and its procedural rules and regulations to the extent and with the frequency it deems necessary; provided, however, that such modifications are in general conformity with the standards set forth in the CC&Rs. IMPORTANT: The CC&R's also have many restrictions and guidelines. Many of these are found in Article 4 "use restrictions".

## Design Review Process
Any change, addition. or modification to a site or building exterior of a residential property requires the prior written approval of the Committee. Residents with proposed changes should contact their management company, with whom the Association has contracted for full Association management. to obtain the necessary Design Review guidelines and submittal documentation.

Simply stated, no new construction, front yard landscaping, or remodeling, including changes in exterior color is to occur on any Lot or exterior of any home without the prior approval of the committee. The responsibility of the Committee is to manage the application and approval process, fairly enforcing guidelines outlined in the governing documents, making objective decisions about guideline compliance, making recommendations to the Board of Directors, reviewing guidelines for adequacy, and educating the community on the guidelines. Your submittal will be returned to you either approved, denied, or for more information once it has been reviewed by the Committee. Homeowners may appeal the decisions of the Committee to the board for consideration, in which case the decision of the Board shall prevail. Such appeals must be requested, in writing/email within 10 calendar days of the date of denial, if this is not received within 10 calendar days from the date of denial, then the decision of the Architectural Review Committee will be final. If you received a denial from the committee, the work is already done, and you do not plan on appealing to the board, you will have 10 calendar days to submit new plans to the committee, then 30 calendar days from the date of approval to complete the revised work.

It is the homeowner's responsibility to ensure that any proposed construction is coordinated with, and where applicable, approved by all counties, local, state and federal government agencies. The Committee, the Management Company and the Association assume no responsibility for obtaining these reviews and approvals. All submittals must have work completed within 90 days of the approval date (except for work that is completed and receive a denial and need revised work).

## General Principals
The Committee monitors any portion of any lot or parcel that is visible from other lots or parcels, the street, or Association common areas. This would include backyards that are visually open to other lots or Association common areas. The Design Guidelines promote those qualities in Castlegate, which enhance the attractiveness and functional utility of the community. Those qualities include a harmonious relationship among structures, vegetation, topography and the overall design of the community.

## Protection of Neighbors
The interest of neighboring property must be protected by making reasonable provisions for such matters as access, surface water drainage, around and sight buffer, light and air, and other aspects of design that may have a substantial effect on neighboring properties.

## Design Compatibility
The proposed construction must be compatible with the design characteristics of the property itself, adjoining properties, and the neighboring setting. Compatibility is defined as harmony in style, scale, materials, color, and construction details.

## Workmanship
The quality of workmanship evidenced in construction must be equal to, or better than, that of the surrounding properties. In addition to being visually objectionable, poor construction practices can cause functional problems and create safety hazards. The Association and the Committee assume no responsibility for the safety or livability of new construction by virtue of design or workmanship.

## Building Architecture
In general, any exterior addition or alteration to an existing residence shall be compatible with the design character of the original structure.

## Minimum Dwelling Size
