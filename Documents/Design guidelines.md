Castlegate Homeowners Association

# Community Guidelines and Rules

(Adopted June 16, 2003; Revised March 2017;)

### Community Organization

Every homeowner of Castlegate is a member of the Castlegate Homeowners' Association (the "Association"), the entity responsible for the management of all common areas and related homeowner’s facilities as well as administration of the affairs of the community. The Association is created by the recording of the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, Restrictions, Reservations and Easements (the "CC&Rs"). The CC&Rs set forth procedures, rules and regulations, which govern the community. These "Design Guidelines and Association rules" are an extension of the CC&Rs and they are designed to be used in harmony.

The Board of Directors (the "Board") is charged with the responsibility for overseeing the business of the Association and has a wide range of powers. The Design Review Committee (the "Committee") is established by the Board to review all improvements within Castlegate including new construction, modifications to existing properties and landscaping. The Committee has adopted Design Review guidelines and standards to evaluate proposed construction activities. The Committee is hereby empowered to supplement and amend the Design Review guidelines and its procedural rules and regulations to the extent and with the frequency it deems necessary; provided, however, that such modifications are in general conformity with the standards set forth in the CC&Rs. IMPORTANT: The CC&R's also have many restrictions and guidelines. Many of these are found in Article 4 "use restrictions".

### Design Review Process
Any change, addition, or modification to a site or building exterior of a residential property requires the prior written approval of the Committee. Residents with proposed changes should contact their management company, with whom the Association has contracted for full Association management, to obtain the necessary Design Review guidelines and submittal documentation.

Simply stated, no new construction, front yard landscaping, or remodeling, including changes in exterior color is to occur on any Lot or exterior of any home without the prior approval of the committee. The responsibility of the Committee is to **manage the application and approval process, fairly enforcing guidelines outlined in the governing documents, making objective decisions about guideline compliance, making recommendations to the Board of Directors, reviewing guidelines for adequacy, and educating the community on the guidelines.** Your submittal will be returned to you either approved, denied, or for more information once it has been reviewed by the Committee. Homeowners may appeal the decisions of the Committee to the board for consideration, in which case the decision of the Board shall prevail.

It is the homeowner's responsibility to ensure that any proposed construction is coordinated with, and where applicable, approved by all counties, local, state and federal government agencies. The Committee, the Management Company and the Association assume no responsibility for obtaining these reviews and approvals.

### General Principals
The Committee monitors any portion of any lot or parcel that is visible from other lots or parcels, the street, or Association common areas. This would include backyards that are visually open to other lots or Association common areas. The Design Guidelines promote those qualities in Castlegate, which enhance the attractiveness and functional utility of the community. Those qualities include a harmonious relationship among structures, vegetation, topography and the overall design of the community.

### Protection of Neighbors
The interest of neighboring property must be protected by making reasonable provisions for such matters as access, surface water drainage, around and sight buffer, light and air, and other aspects of design that may have a substantial effect on neighboring properties.

### Design Compatibility
The proposed construction must be compatible with the design characteristics of the property itself, adjoining properties and the neighboring setting. Compatibility is defined as harmony in style, scale, materials, color and construction details.

### Workmanship
The quality of workmanship evidenced in construction must be equal to, or better than, that of the surrounding properties. In addition to being visually objectionable, poor construction practices can cause functional problems and create safety hazards. The Association and the Committee assume no responsibility for the safety or livability of new construction by virtue of design or workmanship.

### Building Architecture
In general, any exterior addition or alteration to an existing residence shall be compatible with the design character of the original structure.

### Minimum Dwelling Size

Backyard storage sheds detached from the house will be considered provided they are **not more** than 8 feet in height. The shed must be set back a minimum of 4 feet from the side and rear property line. The storage shed shall not be served by any utility (electric, gas or water), and all roof drainage must flow back onto the owner's property. All materials and colors must match the existing house. All such construction must be completed within 90 days of beginning.

Patio covers are attached to the home and must meet current local government building guidelines/codes to receive approval

### Satellite Dishes
While the Association cannot prohibit the use of satellite dishes, they do regulate the size and location of the "dish: All dishes should be placed in the rear yard or on the back side of the home. Any dish larger than one meter (39 inches) may not be visible above the fence line to streets, neighboring property and common areas. Those homes with "view" fencing must locate the dish in the best possible location so as to minimize the visibility from neighboring property and common areas. All dishes that are above the fence line must be painted to match the color of the house. **Prior committee approval is not required.**

### Landscape Guidelines
The Design Review Committee requires that "front yard" (includes visible side yard) landscape plans be submitted for approval before installation. Contact committee before drawing plans. Rear yard Structures which are taller than the fence or are visible from outside the property (swings, gazebos, basketball hoops, trampolines, etc.) also require approval.

Homes must have the front yard landscaping completed within four (4) months of occupancy or closing (whichever occurs first). Prior to landscaping, (and after) all yards must be maintained in a neat, weed‐free, debris free condition.

No tree, shrub, or plant of any kind on any Lot may overhang or otherwise encroach upon any sidewalk or other pedestrian way from ground level to a height of eight (8) feet.

### Driveways
Driveways may not be expanded without the prior approval of the Committee. **Any damage incurred will be the sole responsibility of the homeowner.**

### Swimming Pools
Prior to construction of a swimming pool, a homeowner should contact the Management Company to coordinate the point of construction access to assure damage to common landscaped areas and common perimeter walls is avoided. In most cases, residents will be advised to enter through the side yard wall, from the front of their homes. Any opening that effects a common Association wall shall require a Design Review submittal and a $1000 deposit for such work, payable to the HOA, and refundable after the walls and landscape are returned to their original condition.

The Committee may also require the Association to replace and repair any common wall, which has been effected to insure continuity within the community with the ability to charge back to the member for labor and materials.

Pools may not be backwashed into the drainage ditches, natural washes, common landscaped areas, drainage‐ways or streets. All backwashed water is to be retained on the owner's lot. If necessary, a hold should be dug and filled with tocks to provide for the needed capacity.

Swimming pool fence requirements are regulated. The City should be contacted to determine the safety fence requirements for your pool. For safety reasons, all openings in walls must be securely covered during the construction to prevent children from entering and being injured.

Pool plans will not need prior approval unless there is a feature (pool slide or other structure), which would be visible above the top of the wall. All pool equipment shall be screened from view of neighboring property, streets and common area with walls, which match the Design Review character and color of the house, or the existing wall. If pool equipment is placed near view fencing, space must be allowed to accommodate the screening wall.

### Pool Drainage
No person shall deposit in, sweep upon, or permit to drain into any public right‐of‐way place of the City any garbage, junk, obstruction or similar matter or any hazardous material that impedes passage or is detrimental to public health (gray water). It is unlawful for any person to discharge or cause to be discharged to the sanitary sewers. You must obtain a permit from the Engineering section first.

### Basketball Hoops
Homeowners must submit an application to the Committee for approval prior to the installation or placement of a basketball hoop. Hoops will be allowed as a permanent installation adjacent to the driveway; portable hoops are prohibited. Strict guidelines will be adhered to regarding the quality of equipment and installation and special attention will be paid to placement of the pole on the lot. Backboards may be transparent or a standard type with highly visible logo material prohibited. No lighting designed to illuminate basketball hoops shall be installed without prior written approval of the Committee. Hoops and nets must be maintained in a near new condition.

### Flagpoles
As of 24 April 2002, the House approved bill SB1055‐452R dealing with this subject. It states that, an Association shall not prohibit the outdoor display of the American Flag by an Association member on that member on that member’s property if the American Flag is displayed in a manner consistent with the Federal Flag Code. The Association shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations regarding the placement and manner of the display of the American Flag. The association rules may regulate the location and size of flag poles.

Height: Flagpoles should be limited to a maximum height of 15 feet. This is 9 feet above a typical privacy wait, and approx. 5 feet below the roof line of a single‐story dwelling. This height shouldn't affect neighboring homeowners "view" of surrounding scenery as is often stated as a negative factor. This would also cover "telescoping flagpoles” on the market.’

Location:
Front Yard: Anywhere except for city street, city sidewalk, driveways, or on the shared privacy wall. If owner wishes to install lighting for a patriotic effect, lighting cannot be directed towards streets, common areas or neighboring property.

Back Yard: Anywhere except for the shared privacy wall. If owner wishes to install lighting for a patriotic effect, lighting cannot be directed towards streets, common areas or neighboring property. If placing a flagpole on a house or garage, homeowners are advised to use brackets mounted on the house or garage to display flags. For this particular placement, the Design Review Committee has adopted that the size of the flagpoles not exceed 6 foot in length (such as a staff normally sold with the flag).

Construction: Suggestion would be lightweight aluminum, or fiberglass, rust‐free.

Rating: For wind speeds ‐ minimum 54 MPH (for monsoon season)

The owner will be responsible for all damages should flagpole damage any adjoining property (vehicles, residence, shared privacy wall, etc.). The owner would also be responsible to check with the city for any setback restrictions.
